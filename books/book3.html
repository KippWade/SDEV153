            <p><strong>Review:</strong>Walt Disney loved trains. As a boy, he worked on a train selling items.
            Trains became a big hobby of his, when one of his animators introduced him to working scale models 
            of trains. This is the main reason  that the Disney Parks have some type of Train ride in most of the
            parks.</p>
